# Theme Hook Plugin Manager Release

This fork exists because Omaniri theming is moving quickly, while the original `omaniri-theme-hook` repo appears to have gone stale. `thpm` keeps the idea alive as an actively maintained, Omaniri-focused plugin manager with newer app support and fixes for rough edges that affect daily use.

## New App Support

This release expands the bundled plugin set with several integrations that were missing from the original project:

- **SwayNC** notification theming
- **Foot live colors** for updating existing Foot terminals
- **Obsidian Terminal** plugin colors
- **cliamp** theme support
- **Omaniri branding** sync for theme-provided Fastfetch/About and screensaver logos, installed disabled by default so users can opt in

The supported app list now includes browsers, editors, desktop UI, terminal tools, and game/media apps, with plugins managed through the `thpm` CLI.

## Important Fixes

This release also fixes several issues that could make the hook frustrating or brittle:

- Disabled plugins now stay disabled after `thpm update`
- Missing `colors.toml` now reports the intended error instead of failing with `error: command not found`
- `thpm uninstall` now works as documented
- Uninstall cleanup is best-effort, so missing optional integrations do not abort removal
- Uninstall restores Omaniri's default About and screensaver branding when those source defaults are available
- Installer no longer requires `gum`; it falls back to a plain shell prompt
- `thpm enable <name>` and `thpm disable <name>` now warn when the plugin name does not exist
- README now documents that updates replace bundled plugin files

## Why This Fork

The original [`imbypass/omaniri-theme-hook`](https://github.com/imbypass/omaniri-theme-hook) laid the groundwork, but Omaniri's theme format and ecosystem have kept evolving. This fork focuses on keeping the hook useful for current Omaniri systems, expanding plugin coverage, and making plugin management predictable.
